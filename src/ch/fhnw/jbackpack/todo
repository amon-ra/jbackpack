- remote restore
    - see remote backup just vice versa...

- delete unused classes/methods
    - is there a tool to automate this???

- SMB support
    - "-t cifs" instead of "-t smbfs"?
    - support for domain?
    - listen on all text fields for document changes

- statical code analysis with findbugs and pmd

- help button near size information elements in rdiffchooserpanel

- improve increment browser
    - file preview
    - file search
        - file name
        - file type
        - file size
        - modification time
        - content

- support for other remote file systems
    - nfs
    - curlftpfs
        rdiff-backup fails on curlftpfs 0.9.2 with the following error message
        rdiff_backup.log.LoggerError: Unable to open logfile /home/ronny/10.217.2.44/ronny/backup/rdiff-backup-data/backup.log: [Errno 95] Operation not supported: '/home/ronny/10.217.2.44/ronny/backup/rdiff-backup-data/backup.log'

    - gmailfs
    - webdav
    - wuala (NFS)
    - dropbox

- sshfs for windows: http://dokan-dev.net/en/

- support more options:
    --compare*

- still unsure about that ideas:
    - use "+" and "-" prefixes in one single temporary includes/excludes file
    - support --max-file-size and --min-file-size options

- make session statistics available

- some things that do not work because of Swing bugs:
    - MetalFileChooserUI.DirectoryComboBoxModel always uses initial
      FileSystemView
      -> impossible to reliably update the FileSystemView on a chooser

- encryption does not work with remote root directories
  (only works with subdirectories in writable parent directories)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- command line database access (no bug, just an information...)
    export DERBY_HOME=/home/archiv/java/derby/db-derby-10.6.1.0-bin/
    java -jar $DERBY_HOME/lib/derbyrun.jar ij
    CONNECT 'jdbc:derby:jbackpack;create=true';
